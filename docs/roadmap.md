Milestone A review gate (before Phase 2):

1. Feature scenarios explicitly cover 1-2 qubit deterministic evolution and Pauli expectation references.
2. Property coverage includes both gate-composition invariants and state normalization invariants.

5. v0.3 spec includes feature-to-step mapping and aligns with implemented foundation behavior.

## Known Gaps (Post-v0.3 Foundation)

1. Hardware-provider depth is still early (job lifecycle/calibration/provider-specific contracts need expansion).

## Phase 6 - v0.4 P0: Dynamic Execution + Hardware Bridges

Milestone H review gate (positioning readiness):

1. Positioning docs make differentiators explicit without hiding current limitations.
2. Migration guides and side-by-side examples are runnable and verified.

2. Provider-specific lifecycle differences (state models, cancellation semantics, calibration/result payloads) are not yet normalized in a public contract.

  - `docs/adr/0004-aws-braket-provider-adapter.md`
  - `docs/adr/0005-azure-quantum-provider-adapter.md`
  - `docs/adr/0006-opentelemetry-observability-standard.md`

Milestone I review gate (before Phase 10):

1. IBM Runtime and AWS Braket adapters execute `submit`, `poll`, `cancel`, and `fetch_result` through `NxQuantum.ProviderBridge`.
2. Provider-specific statuses/errors are mapped into stable typed NxQuantum contracts.
3. Unsupported capability requests fail fast with typed diagnostics (no silent fallback across providers).
4. Feature/contract tests are reproducible via deterministic fixtures and CI smoke lanes.

## Phase 10 - v0.5 P1: Azure Quantum + Cross-Provider Normalization

  - `docs/v0.5-migration-packs.md`

5. Observability artifacts (traces/logs/metrics conventions + dashboards) are published and validated.

## Known Gaps (Post-v0.5 Provider Foundation)

1. Five provider scenario families are still scaffold-only at step implementation level and need full executable assertion coverage.
2. Provider adapters remain fixture-first and require transport seam hardening for optional live smoke lanes while preserving deterministic defaults.
3. Documentation status notes still contain some stale “pending/planned” wording for already implemented v0.5 paths.

## Phase 12 - v0.6: Contract Completion and Adapter Hardening

- [ ] Harden provider adapter transport seams for optional live smoke lanes while preserving fixture-first deterministic defaults.
- [ ] Convert remaining scaffold-only provider scenario step modules into executable assertion-driven behavior checks.

- [ ] Publish v0.6 feature specification:
  - `docs/v0.6-feature-spec.md`
- [ ] Publish v0.6 acceptance criteria and feature-to-step execution mapping:
  - `docs/v0.6-acceptance-criteria.md`
  - `docs/v0.6-feature-to-step-mapping.md`

Milestone L/M/N review gate (v0.6 readiness):

2. Fixture lanes remain deterministic and reproducible across repeated runs.
3. Optional live smoke-lane readiness is validated without public API contract drift.
4. Roadmap/spec/acceptance/release docs are internally consistent for v0.6 status.

## Phase 13 - v0.7: Standalone Production Hardening + External Operations Interoperability

- [ ] Stabilize external operations integration contracts (capability/lifecycle/error envelope versioning + deterministic serialization).
- [ ] Harden observability schema governance and adapter strategy across `high_level`, `granular`, and `forensics`.
- [ ] Publish standalone production and external integration profile guidance with executable examples.
- [ ] Add release evidence checks for contract stability and schema compatibility.
- [ ] Publish v0.7 feature specification:
  - `docs/v0.7-feature-spec.md`

Milestone O/P/Q review gate (v0.7 readiness):

1. Lifecycle/capability/error contracts are versioned, documented, and schema-tested.
2. Observability schema and redaction/cardinality invariants are stable across profiles.
3. Standalone production workflows remain green with no dependency on external orchestration systems.
4. External clients can consume deterministic machine-readable contracts without undocumented parsing behavior.
