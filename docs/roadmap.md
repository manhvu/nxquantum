Milestone H review gate (positioning readiness):

1. Positioning docs make differentiators explicit without hiding current limitations.
2. Migration guides and side-by-side examples are runnable and verified.
3. Public narrative is backed by reproducible data (benchmarks and workflow evidence), not only claims.

## Known Gaps (Post-v0.4 Positioning)

1. Top-3 provider production adapters are not yet implemented end-to-end (`IBM Runtime`, `AWS Braket`, `Azure Quantum`).
2. Provider-specific lifecycle differences (state models, cancellation semantics, calibration/result payloads) are not yet normalized in a public contract.
3. Migration assets still require provider-specific implementation guidance and executable acceptance mapping.

## Phase 9 - v0.5 P0: Production Provider Bridges (IBM Runtime + AWS Braket)

5. Observability artifacts (traces/logs/metrics conventions + dashboards) are published and validated.

## Known Gaps (Post-v0.5 Provider Foundation)

1. v0.5 post-foundation gaps were addressed in Phase 12 (v0.6) contract completion and adapter hardening.

2. Observability schema and redaction/cardinality invariants are stable across profiles.
3. Standalone production workflows remain green with no dependency on external orchestration systems.
4. External clients can consume deterministic machine-readable contracts without undocumented parsing behavior.

## Known Gaps (Post-v0.7 Standalone Hardening)

1. Provider adapters remain fixture-first in practice; true remote execution on cloud hardware targets is not yet delivered behind the same typed contracts.
2. Compilation/transpilation depth is still limited versus Python-first stacks for device-aware optimization and routing strategy breadth.
3. Observability contracts are stable but troubleshooting depth (custom attributes, poll-phase diagnostics, retry/correlation detail) remains shallow for incident forensics.
4. High-value cross-ecosystem performance evidence is still concentrated on simulator micro paths and does not yet cover full provider-lifecycle and production-like Q/ML rollout scenarios.

## Phase 14 - v0.8 P0: Live Provider Execution (Top-3) Behind Stable Contracts

Goal:

1. Deliver real cloud provider execution while preserving deterministic fixture parity and typed lifecycle contracts.

Implementation deliverables:

2. Fixture and live lanes share identical public contract shape (`schema_version`, `correlation_id`, `idempotency_key`).
3. Provider-specific live failures map into stable typed NxQuantum error codes and metadata.
4. CI keeps deterministic fixture gates mandatory and adds optional credentialed live verification lanes.

## Phase 15 - v0.8 P1: Compilation and Transpilation Value Upgrade

4. Add explicit support for user-provided correlation metadata propagation across provider bridge operations.
5. Publish incident playbooks and updated dashboards for live-provider troubleshooting.
6. Add acceptance tests for custom-attribute policy, cardinality guardrails, and redaction invariants.

   - `docs/quantum-llm-vision.md`

## Milestone Template Policy (Required for All Unfinished Phases)

Every unfinished roadmap phase (currently Phase 14 onward) must include:

1. `Goal` section (explicit business/engineering outcome).
