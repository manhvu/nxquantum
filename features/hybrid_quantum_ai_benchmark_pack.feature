Feature: Hybrid quantum AI benchmark pack

  Rule: Hybrid quantum AI value claims are benchmarked against classical baselines
    Scenario Outline: Hybrid scenario family <scenario_family> is reproducible and baseline-anchored
      Given hybrid benchmark scenario <scenario_family> is part of the evaluation pack
      When <scenario_family> benchmark scenario is implemented
      Then benchmark baseline and report scripts consume the same dataset manifests and pinned seeds for <scenario_family>
      And each <scenario_family> scenario reports classical baseline metrics with version-pinned environment metadata
      And CI benchmark guards enforce regression thresholds for <scenario_family> quality latency and fallback behavior
      And all roadmap expectations for this feature are implementation-ready

      Examples:
        | scenario_family                   |
        | reranking quality delta           |
        | constrained optimization assistant |
        | fallback latency impact           |

    Scenario: Benchmark caveats and assumptions are explicit in reports
      Given hybrid benchmark reports include operational caveats
      When hybrid benchmark reports are published
      Then benchmark outputs include caveat labels for noise provider and fallback-path assumptions
      And caveat sections distinguish measured behavior from unsupported or simulated paths
      And published guides map benchmark evidence to migration and rollout decision workflows
      And all roadmap expectations for this feature are implementation-ready

    Scenario: Benchmark artifact bundles are decision-usable
      Given migration teams rely on benchmark artifacts for go no-go decisions
      When benchmark pack artifacts are finalized
      Then artifact bundles include scenario metadata baseline metadata and confidence notes
      And report formats include machine-readable summary and human-readable narrative sections
      And artifact schemas are versioned for CI ingestion and trend tracking
      And all roadmap expectations for this feature are implementation-ready
