Feature: Quantum AI tool contracts

  Rule: AI tool invocation contracts stay typed stable and transport-agnostic
    Scenario: Envelope schemas are versioned and machine-consumable
      Given quantum AI tool envelope contracts are required for production integrations
      When AI envelope schemas are delivered
      Then request result error and trace metadata envelopes are versioned and machine-readable
      And envelope schemas include schema_version tool_name correlation_id and idempotency_key fields
      And contract tests validate envelope parsing schema compliance and typed error mapping
      And all roadmap expectations for this feature are implementation-ready

    Scenario Outline: Tool handler <tool_handler> contract is deterministic
      Given AI tool handler <tool_handler> is part of the public NxQuantum AI surface
      When <tool_handler> handler implementation is delivered
      Then tool handler <tool_handler> returns typed result envelopes with deterministic fallback outcomes
      And handler <tool_handler> emits capability diagnostics when required provider features are unavailable
      And handler <tool_handler> documents input output and failure contracts in public docs
      And all roadmap expectations for this feature are implementation-ready

      Examples:
        | tool_handler                    |
        | quantum-kernel reranking        |
        | constrained optimization helper |

    Scenario Outline: Transport model <transport_model> remains adapter-driven behind stable ports
      Given AI tool transport model <transport_model> is required for integration
      When AI tool transport adapters for <transport_model> are implemented
      Then AI tool transport ports define <transport_model> contract semantics behind adapters
      And reference adapters include MCP JSON-RPC sync transport and CloudEvents async transport
      And transport adapter substitution preserves typed envelope compatibility
      And all roadmap expectations for this feature are implementation-ready

      Examples:
        | transport_model      |
        | sync request-response |
        | async event delivery |
