# NxQuantum

NxQuantum is a pure-Elixir quantum ML library for the `Nx` ecosystem.
It is built for ML engineers and researchers who want quantum primitives inside the same BEAM stack used for training loops, inference services, and production pipelines.

## Who It Is For

- Teams building ML systems in Elixir/Nx that need deterministic quantum primitives in the same runtime.
- Researchers who want reproducible, typed contracts and BEAM-native integration patterns.
- Not a primary fit (today) for teams whose top requirement is immediate broad hardware-provider coverage.

## Why It Matters

Quantum tooling is mostly Python-first today. NxQuantum focuses on the Elixir/Nx community by providing:

- Elixir-native primitives (`Estimator`, `Sampler`, `Kernels`, `Transpiler`).
- Deterministic behavior with explicit runtime and seed contracts.
- A cleaner path from research code to BEAM production systems.

## Choose Your Path

- Evaluate vs Python-first workflows: [docs/python-comparison-workflows.md](docs/python-comparison-workflows.md)
- Plan migration from Python workflows: [docs/migration-python-playbook.md](docs/migration-python-playbook.md)
- Use provider-specific migration packs: [docs/v0.5-migration-packs.md](docs/v0.5-migration-packs.md)
- Start interactive tutorials: [docs/livebook-tutorials.md](docs/livebook-tutorials.md)
- Check provider support tiers and limits: [docs/v0.5-provider-support-tiers.md](docs/v0.5-provider-support-tiers.md)
- Review reproducible provider benchmark matrix: [docs/v0.5-benchmark-matrix.md](docs/v0.5-benchmark-matrix.md)
- Review benchmark narrative evidence: [docs/case-study-beam-integration.md](docs/case-study-beam-integration.md)

## Quick Start

```bash
mise trust
mise install
mix setup
mix run examples/quantum_kernel_classifier.exs
```

For full setup and API walkthroughs and usage examples:

- [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md)

## Main Features (Current)

- Circuit construction and expectation estimation.
- Shot-based sampling with deterministic seeds.
- Batched estimator/sampler APIs.
- Gradient modes (`backprop`, `parameter_shift`, `adjoint`).
- Error mitigation pipeline (`readout`, `zne_linear`).
- Topology-aware transpilation interface.
- Quantum kernel matrix generation.

## What Is Still Planned

- Additional provider depth beyond top-3 v0.5 adapters.
- Broader provider-native dynamic and non-gate-model paths.
- More benchmark-backed case studies across real BEAM deployment patterns.
